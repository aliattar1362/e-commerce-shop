# Frontend project

## Overview

This project leverages React.ts and Redux Toolkit to enhance skills in fetching, displaying, and searching data from designated API endpoints. It also incorporates advanced features such as multi-page routing and authentication, providing a comprehensive learning experience for building an e-commerce shop.

## Custom Hooks

- **useFetch(productsEndpoint: string): [Product[], boolean, string | null]**: This hook retrieves an array containing product objects, each accompanied by its respective properties. The `productsEndpoint` parameter specifies the API endpoint for fetching products. The hook returns a tuple containing three elements:
  - An array of product objects.
  - A boolean indicating whether the data is currently being fetched (`true` during the fetch operation).
  - A string representing any error that occurred during the fetch operation (`null` if no errors occurred).

This data is employed to render the complete list of products on the UI product page.

## Routes

The project utilizes the latest version of React Router for navigation, comprising the following main pages:

- **Home:** The landing page providing an overview of the application.
- **Products:** Displaying a list of available products for users to explore and purchase.

- **Cart:** Showcasing the selected products added to the shopping cart.

Additionally, there are two private pages:

- **Profile:** A user-specific page displaying personalized information and order history.

- **Admin Pages:** Exclusive pages for administrators to manage product listings and user data.

Furthermore, there is a sub-page for product details:

- **Product Details:** Accessible through the Products page, providing detailed information about a specific product.

Users can navigate between these pages seamlessly using React Router. Ensure to handle any necessary route parameters and implement any logic required for private routes.
